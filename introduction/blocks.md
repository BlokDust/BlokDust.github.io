# Blocks

Blocks are the fundamental components of BlokDust from which everything is made.

Blocks can be created by dragging & dropping from the top menu, and come in four categories: Source, Effects, Power & Interaction.

They will connect with other suitable blocks automatically when in close proximity, which is indicated with connection lines drawn between the blocks.

Source blocks create a source of sound, ( a sample, an oscillator, or a microphone input etc) and can have effect blocks connected to them which will in some way alter that sound. 

To start creating sound, a source block must either be powered with a connected power block, or controlled with a connected interaction block.

Each block has it’s own settings. Single-clicking on a block will open it’s options panel where various effect parameters can be changed or played.
