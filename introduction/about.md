#About

BlokDust allows for the creation of synths, loops, effects and self-playing environments. Based around simple connections and a stripped-down graphic interface, it makes the creation process accessible while still allowing for more complex and unique creations, and bringing sound creation to the web in a new way.

BlokDust was created from a concept by Luke Twyman, and developed in collaboration with Luke Phillips and Edward Silverton. Early concepting and design began in January 2014, with development commencing in September. First Beta release arrived September 2015.

Influence for the project’s functionality came in part from the ‘Redstone’ aspect of the video game Minecraft, while the visual style from early Lego and the music controller Reactable.

The project is coded in Javascript/Typescript, displayed using Canvas, and sound is generated using the Web Audio API. Much of the audio makes use of the framework Tone.js developed by Yotam Mann.
